#summary Introduction to arbotiX software.

= Introduction =

The arbotiX robocontroller is an advanced control solution for small-to-medium size robots. It incorporates a powerful AVR microcontroller, XBEE wireless radio, dual motor drivers, and 3-pin servo-style headers for IO.

The arbotiX robocontroller is specifically designed to control robots built using Bioloid servos, although it is also a very high-end solution for powerful rovers. It is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for a CM-5, rather it is intended as a high level development tool for building more sophisticated robots.

= Software =

A number of software programs have been designed to make working with your arbotiX quite easy:
 * BioloidLibrary - this is a Bioloid-bus library for use with the Arduino/Sanguino environment. It allows easy manipulation of poses, the storage of poses in FLASH, and full interaction with AX-12 servos. 
 * PyPose - this is the stock pose & capture software. Written in Python, uses pySerial to communicate with an arbotiX board running the _pypose_ sketch. After you have done pose and capture, PyPose can automatically create a C header file with the poses ready to load with the _Bioloid Library_.

= Examples =

The arbotiX was originally designed for IssyDunnYet, the 2009 Gold Medalist in Mech Warfare. The full source code of Issy 2009 is freely available. 

Other examples will be posted as they are finished.
