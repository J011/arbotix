#summary Releases

ArbotiX software, especially PyPose, is continuously under development. The underlying BioloidController and other libraries are for the most part static, while new features may be added from time to time and code may be tuned, the overall interface is mostly set in stone. PyPose is R&D software, created by roboticists, for roboticists. As such, releases for PyPose will come frequently. 

= Version 1.0a - October 18, 2009 =
This release is the first fully functional release. There are several changes to the BioloidController library, and many upgrades and bug fixes for PyPose. Users who installed Beta releases should do a complete upgrade. Those who installed release candidates only need to upgrade their libraries, the pypose sketch, and PyPose itself.

Known Issues:
 # On some systems, ports may not be recognized. It is recommended to use the *serial* command inside the _Servo Terminal_.
 # The screen may not resize correctly at times, it is recommended that you switch to a different tool and then back to the desired tool if the screen does not show some controls.

This page is geared towards end users. The DevelopmentTimeline page has more details for programmers who want to keep up on internal details of PyPose.
