#summary Development Timeline

This page is geared towards developers and power-users. For general coverage of releases, see the ArbotixReleases page. 

Note: We originally used a V1.1 type release number -- but this gets complex with so many releases. We've now moved to an Arduino-style release versioning, 0001, 0002, etc.

= Improvement and Developments Outline =
   * BioloidController updates to allow RX servo control. - <font color="#0000FF">_Final Testing_</font>
   * AX-S1 support macros - <font color="#FF0000">_in progress_</font>
   * Support for Mammal 3DOF - <font color="#0000FF">_Final Testing_</font>
   * new examples: a rover with closed loop feedback
   * Port Dialog Overhaul: Make the "open port" dialog easier to use. Add ability to switch driver characteristics.
   * Finish the Servo Terminal: Specifically, add the ability to fiddle with registers in a meaningful and easy fashion. 
   * New IK Templates: currently we have 3DOF Lizard, 3DOF Mammal. We'd like to add: 
     # 4DOF Lizard.
     # 4DOF Biped. - <font color="#FF0000">_in progress_</font>
     # 5DOF Biped.
   * New Gaits: We currently have a number of Ripple, Amble, and Tripod Gaits. We'd like to add: 
     # Geometrically Stable Ripple. - <font color="#FF0000">_in progress_</font>
     # Possibly add support for planar tails to assist with stability.
   * Gait Template Structure: Currently, gaits are integrated into the templates, eventually we would like to support separate gait files. - <font color="#FF0000">_in progress_</font>
