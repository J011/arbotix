#summary Other software libraries for the arbotiX

_Page Under Construction_

= Motors2 =
This library implements a dual motor driver using Timer2, it can be used to control the onboard motor driver on the arbotiX.

= SharpIR =
This library allows easy usage of a number of Sharp IR ranging sensors. 

= Srf05 =
This library allows easy usage of an SRF-05 sonar ranger, in single-pin mode. The SRF-05 uses a pulse out to give distance, this library will read the pulse, and then return the distance in centimeters to the nearest object. 

{{{
#include <Srf05.h>

// attach an SRF-05 to digital pin 5. Be sure that it is setup for single pin mode.
Srf05 mySonar = Srf05(5);  

void setup(){
    Serial.begin(38400);
}

// print distance in CM, every second. 
void loop(){  
    Serial.println(mySonar.getData());
    delay(1000);
}
