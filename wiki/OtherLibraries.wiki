#summary Other software libraries for the arbotiX

= Motors2 =
This library implements a dual motor driver using Timer2, it can be used to control the onboard motor driver on the arbotiX. It has several functions:
  * *set(l_pwm,r_pwm)* - set the left and right motor speeds at the same time.
  * *left(l_pwm)* - set the left motor speed.
  * *right(r_pwm)* - set the right motor speed. 
Motor speeds are between -255 and 255. -255 is full reverse, 0 is stopped, and 255 is full speed forward. 

{{{ 
#include <Motors2.h>

Motors2 drive = Motors2();

void setup(){
    drive.set(-255,-255); // drive backwards at full speed 
    delay(1000);

    drive.set(0,0); // stop
    delay(1000);

    drive.set(100,100); // drive forward at half speed
    delay(1000);

    drive.left(0); // stop the left motor, turn in place
    delay(500);    
    drive.right(50); // cut right motor speed in half
    delay(500)
    drive.right(0); // and stop
}

void loop(){
    
}

= Serial =
The default _Serial_ library that comes with Arduino environment will work with either the FTDI cable or the XBEE radio on the arbotiX _(remember, don't connect both the FTDI and the XBEE at the same time)._ We suggest using 38400 as the baud rate, since all of our demos use that.   

= SharpIR =
This library allows easy usage of a number of Sharp IR ranging sensors. Each IR ranger uses on analog pin. The library function _getData()_ converts the analog voltage into a distance in centimeters. 

When creating a our SharpIR object, we need to pass both the type of sensor connected, and which analog pin it is connected to. The analog pins are numbered 0-7. The valid types are: 
  * *GP2D12* - The original analog IR ranger in the Sharp family of sensors. Mid range sensor, 4"-32" range. Use this for sensors marked as GP2D12 or GP2Y0A21YK (which is a newer ROHS version).
  * *GP2D120* - Short range sensor, 1.5"-12" range.
  * *GP2Y0A02YK* - Long range sensor, 8"-60" range. 

It is important to select the correct sensors type, or the conversion will be incorrect and you will receive incorrect and useless range data. 

{{{
#include <SharpIR.h>

// To create an object, we need to pass both the type, and the analog pin being used
SharpIR myIR = SharpIR(GP2D120,0);

void setup(){
    Serial.begin(38400);
}

// print distance in CM, every second
void loop(){		
    Serial.println(myIR.getData());
    delay(1000);	
}
}}}

= Srf05 =
This library allows easy usage of an SRF-05 sonar ranger, in single-pin mode. The SRF-05 does no on-board conversion of the pulse width to length, that is the primary purpose of this library. _getData()_ sends out a ping, reads the return pulse, and then returns the distance in centimeters to the nearest object. _Note: getData() should not be called faster than ~20-30Hz, to allow for ring-down time on the sonar._

{{{
#include <Srf05.h>

// attach an SRF-05 to digital pin 5. Be sure that it is setup for single pin mode.
Srf05 mySonar = Srf05(5);  

void setup(){
    Serial.begin(38400);
}

// print distance in CM, every second. 
void loop(){  
    Serial.println(mySonar.getData());
    delay(1000);
}
