#summary Setting Up Your RX Bridge

= Introduction =
The RX Bridge is an ArbotiX add-on board that enables control of DX/RX/EX series servos.

= Setup = 
 # Remove jumper J1 from your ArbotiX to decouple the rx and tx lines of the serial port.
 # Plug the RX-Bbridge into the ArbotiX. The outer 3-pin header plugs into the row of pins marked S1, which previously were jumpered with J1
 # Use the standoff to connect the RX-Bridge securely

= Software =
To enable support for the RX servos, we need to edit our BioloidController library just a bit. Open ax12.h, found in the Bioloid folder of your Arduino Libraries folder, and uncomment the line near the top that says _#define RX_PROTOCOL 1_:

{{{
#ifndef ax12_h
#define ax12_h

// Uncomment the following line if you wish to use the RX-Bridge
#define RX_PROTOCOL 1

#define AX12_MAX_SERVOS             18
}}}

That's it! You're now setup to use RX servos just like you used to use AX servos with your ArbotiX. 

_Note: EX servos have a 12-bit range, not a 10-bit range, PyPose 0013 does not yet have support for a 12-bit range_
